"""
Allows using SWI Prolog as an embedded part of an application, "like a library".

`swiplserver` enables SWI Prolog queries to be executed from within your Python application as if Python had a Prolog engine running inside of it. Queries are sent as strings like "atom(foo)" and the response is JSON.

`swiplserver` provides:

 - The `PrologServer` class that automatically manages starting and stopping the SWI Prolog instance(s) and runs the `language_server/1` predicate which starts a JSON query server.
 - The `PrologThread` class is used to run queries on the created process. Queries are run exactly as they would be if you were interacting with the SWI Prolog "top level" (i.e. the Prolog command line).

Installation:

    1. Install SWI Prolog (www.swi-prolog.org) and ensure that "swipl" is on the system path.
    2. Either "pip install swiplserver" or copy the "swiplserver" library (the whole directory) from the "libs" directory of your SWI Prolog installation or the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EricZinda/swiplserver) to be a subdirectory of your Python project.
    3. Check if your SWI Prolog version includes the Language Server by launching it and typing `?- language_server([]).` If it can't find it, see below for how to install it.

    If your SWI Prolog doesn't yet include the language server:

    1. Download the `language_server.pl` file from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EricZinda/swiplserver/tree/main/language_server).
    2. Open an operating system command prompt and go to the directory where you downloaded `language_server.pl`.
    3. Run the below command. On Windows the command prompt must be [run as an administrator](https://www.wikihow.com/Run-Command-Prompt-As-an-Administrator-on-Windows). On Mac or Linux, start the command with `sudo` as in `sudo swipl -s ...`.

    ~~~
    swipl -s language_server.pl -g "language_server:install_to_library('language_server.pl')" -t halt
    ~~~
Usage:

    `PrologThread` represents a thread in *Prolog* (it is not a Python thread!). A given `PrologThread` instance will always run queries on the same Prolog thread (i.e. single threaded within Prolog).

    To run a query and wait until all results are returned:

        from swiplserver import PrologServer, PrologThread

        with PrologServer() as server:
            with server.create_thread() as prolog_thread:
                result = prolog_thread.query("atom(a)")
                print(result)

        True

    To run a query that returns multiple results and retrieve them as they are available:

        from swiplserver import PrologServer, PrologThread

        with PrologServer() as server:
            with server.create_thread() as prolog_thread:
                prolog_thread.query_async("member(X, [first, second, third])",
                                          find_all=False)
                while True:
                    result = prolog_thread.query_async_result()
                    if result is None:
                        break
                    else:
                        print(result)
        first
        second
        third

    Creating two `PrologThread` instances allows queries to be run on multiple threads in Prolog:

        from swiplserver import PrologServer, PrologThread

        with PrologServer() as server:
            with server.create_thread() as prolog_thread1:
                with server.create_thread() as prolog_thread2:
                    prolog_thread1.query_async("sleep(2), writeln(first_thread(true))")
                    prolog_thread2.query_async("sleep(1), writeln(second_thread(true))")
                    thread1_answer = prolog_thread1.query_async_result()
                    thread2_answer = prolog_thread2.query_async_result()

        Prolog: second_thread(true)
        Prolog: first_thread(true)

    Output printed in Prolog using `writeln/1` or errors output by Prolog itself are written to Python's logging facility using the `swiplserver` log and shown prefixed with "Prolog:" as above.

    Answers to Prolog queries that are not simply `True` or `False` are converted to JSON using the [json_to_prolog/2](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/doc_for?object=json_to_prolog/2) predicate in Prolog. They are returned as a Python `dict` with query variables as the keys and standard JSON as the values. If there is more than one answer, it is returned as a list:

        from swiplserver import PrologServer, PrologThread

        with PrologServer() as server:
            with server.create_thread() as prolog_thread:
                result = prolog_thread.query("member(X, [color(blue), color(red)])")
                print(result)

        [{'X': {'functor': 'color', 'args': ['blue']}},
         {'X': {'functor': 'color', 'args': ['red']}}]

Exceptions in Prolog code are raised using Python's native exception facilities.

Debugging:
    When using `swiplserver`, debugging the Prolog code itself can often be done by viewing traces from the Prolog native `writeln/1` or `debug/3` predicates and viewing their output in the debugger output window.  Sometimes an issue occurs deep in an application and it would be easier to set breakpoints and view traces in Prolog itself. Running SWI Prolog manually and launching the server that `swiplserver` uses within it in "Standalone mode" is designed for this scenario.

    `swiplserver` normally launches SWI Prolog and starts the `language_server/1` predicate within it so that it can connect and run queries. This predicate is defined in the `language_server.pl` file included in the `swiplserver` module. To debug your code using Prolog itself, you can do this manually and connect your application to it. A typical flow for standalone mode is:

    1. Launch SWI Prolog and call the `language_server/1` predicate defined in the `language_server.pl` file that is part of the module, specifying a port and password (documentation is [here]( https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/swiplserver/language_server/language_server.html)). Use the `tdebug/0` predicate to set all threads to debugging mode like this: `tdebug, language_server(port(4242), password(debugnow))`.
    2. Set the selected port and password when you call `PrologServer.__init__()`.
    3. Launch the application and go through the steps to reproduce the issue.

    (As the language server is a multithreaded application, debugging the running code requires using the multithreaded debugging features of SWI Prolog as described in the section on "Debugging Threads" in the SWI Prolog documentation.)

    At this point, all of the multi-threaded debugging tools in SWI Prolog are available for debugging the problem. If the issue is an unhandled or unexpected exception, the exception debugging features of SWI Prolog can be used to break on the exception and examine the state of the application.  If it is a logic error, breakpoints can be set to halt at the point where the problem appears, etc.

Note that, while using a library to access Prolog will normally end and restart the process between runs of the code, running the server standalone doesn't clear state between launches of the application.  You'll either need to relaunch between runs or build your application so that it does the initialization at startup.

        Initialize a PrologServer class that manages a SWI Prolog process associated with your application process. `PrologServer.start()` actually launches the process if launch_server is True.

        This class is designed to allow Prolog to be used "like a normal Python library" -- not as a central server that multiple applications connect to. Thus, all communication is done using protocols that only work on the same machine as your application (localhost TCP/IP or Unix Domain Sockets), and the implementation is designed to make sure the process doesn't hang around even if the application is terminated unexpectedly (as with halting a debugger).

        All arguments are optional and the defaults are set to the recommended settings that work best on all platforms during development. In production on Unix systems, consider using unix_domain_socket to further decrease security attack surface area.

        For debugging scenarios, SWI Prolog can be launched manually and this class can be configured to (locally) connect to it using launch_server = False. This allows for inspection of the server state and using the SWI Prolog debugging tools while your application is running. See the documentation for the Prolog `language_server/1` predicate for more information on how to run the language server in "Standalone Mode".

        Examples:
            To automatically launch a SWI Prolog process using TCP/IP localhost to communicate with an automatically chosen port and password (the default):

                with PrologServer() as server:
                    # your code here

            To connect to an existing SWI Prolog process that has already started the language_server/1 predicate and is using an automatically generated Unix Domain Socket and a password of '8UIDSSDXLPOI':

                with PrologServer(launch_server = False,
                                  unix_domain_socket = '',
                                  password = '8UIDSSDXLPOI') as server:
                    # your code here

        Args:
            launch_server: True (default) launch a SWI Prolog process on `PrologServer.start()` and shuts it down automatically on `PrologServer.stop()` (or after a resource manager like the Python "with" statement exits). False connects to an existing SWI Prolog process that is running the language_server/1 predicate (i.e. "Standalone Mode"). When False, password and one of port or unix_domain_socket must be specified to match the options provided to `language_server/1` in the separate SWI Prolog process.

            port: The TCP/IP localhost port to use for communication with the SWI Prolog process. Ignored if unix_domain_socket is not None.

                - When launch_server is True, None (default) automatically picks an open port that the server and this class both use.
                - When launch_server is False, must be set to match the port specified in language_server/1 of the running SWI Prolog process.

            password: The password to use for connecting to the SWI Prolog process. This is to prevent malicious users from connecting to the server since it can run arbitrary code.  Allowing the server to generate a strong password by using None is recommended.

                - When launch_server is True, None (default) automatically generates a strong password using a uuid. Other values specify the password to use.
                - When launch_server is False, must be set to match the password specified in language_server/1 of the running SWI Prolog process.

            unix_domain_socket: None (default) use localhost TCP/IP for communication with the SWI Prolog process. Otherwise (only on Unix) is either a fully qualified path and filename of the Unix Domain Socket to use or an empty string (recommended). An empty string will cause a temporary directory to be created using Prolog's `tmp_file/2` and a socket file will be created within that directory following the below requirements.  If the directory and file are unable to be created for some reason, `PrologServer.start()` with raise an exception. Specifying a file to use should follow the same guidelines as the generated file:

                - If the file exists when the server is launched, it will be deleted.
                - The Prolog process will attempt to create and, if Prolog exits cleanly, delete this file when the server closes.  This means the directory must have the appropriate permissions to allow the Prolog process to do so.
                - For security reasons, the filename should not be predictable and the directory it is contained in should have permissions set so that files created are only accessible to the current user.
                - The path must be below 92 *bytes* long (including null terminator) to be portable according to the Linux documentation.

            query_timeout_seconds: None (default) set the default timeout for all queries to be infinite (this can be changed on a per query basis). Other values set the default timeout in seconds.

            pending_connection_count: Set the default number of pending connections allowed on the server. Since the server is only connected to by your application and is not a server, this value should probably never be changed unless your application is creating new `PrologThread` objects at a very high rate.

                - When launch_server is True, None uses the default (5) and other values set the count.
                - When launch_server is False, ignored.

            output_file_name: Provide the file name for a file to redirect all Prolog output (STDOUT and STDERR) to. Used for debugging or gathering a log of Prolog output. None outputs all Prolog output to the Python logging infrastructure using the 'swiplserver' log.  If using multiple servers in one SWI Prolog instance, only set this on the first one.  Each time it is set the output will be deleted and redirected.

            server_traces: (Only used in unusual debugging circumstances) Since these are Prolog traces, where they go is determined by output_file_name.

                - None (the default) does not turn on language_server tracing
                - "_" turns on all tracing output from Prolog `language_server/1` server (i.e. runs `debug(language_server(_)).` in Prolog).
                - "protocol" turns on only protocol level messages (which results in much less data in the trace for large queries)
                - "query" turns on only messages about the query.

            prolog_path: (Only used for unusual testing situations) Set the path to where the swipl executable can be found

            prolog_path_args: (Only used for unusual testing situations) Set extra command line arguments to be sent to swipl when it is launched.

            ValueError if the arguments don't make sense.  For example: choosing Unix Domain Sockets on Windows or setting output_file with launch_server = False

        Attempt to cancel a query started with `PrologThread.query_async()` in a way that allows further queries to be run on this `PrologThread` afterwards.

        If there is a query running, injects a Prolog `throw(cancel_goal)` into the query's thread. Does not inject Prolog `abort/0` because this would kill the thread and we want to keep the thread alive for future queries.  This means it is a "best effort" cancel since the exception can be caught by your Prolog code. `cancel_query_async()` is guaranteed to either raise an exception (if there is no query or pending results from the last query), or safely attempt to stop the last executed query.

        To guaranteed that a query is cancelled, call `PrologThread.stop()` instead.

        It is not necessary to determine the outcome of `cancel_query_async()` after calling it. Further queries can be immediately run after calling `cancel_query_async()`. They will be run after the current query stops for whatever reason.

        If you do need to determine the outcome or determine when the query stops, call `PrologThread.query_async_result(wait_timeout_seconds = 0)`. Using `wait_timeout_seconds = 0` is recommended since the query might have caught the exception or still be running.  Calling `PrologThread.query_async_result()` will return the "natural" result of the goal's execution. The "natural" result depends on the particulars of what the code actually did. The return value could be one of:

        - Raise `PrologQueryCancelledError` if the goal was running and did not catch the exception. I.e. the goal was successfully cancelled.
        - Raise `PrologQueryTimeoutError` if the query timed out before getting cancelled.
        - Raise `PrologError` (i.e. an arbitrary exception) if query hits another exception before it has a chance to be cancelled.
        - A valid answer if the query finished before being cancelled.

        Note that you will need to continue calling `PrologThread.query_async_result()` until you receive `None` or an exception to be sure the query is finished (see documentation for `PrologThread.query_async_result()`).

        Raises:
            `PrologNoQueryError` if there was no query running and no results that haven't been retrieved yet from the last query.

Each call to `query_async_result()` returns one result and either `None` or raises an exception when there are no more results.  Any raised exception except for `PrologResultNotAvailableError` indicates there are no more results. If `PrologThread.query_async()` was run with `find_all == False`, multiple `query_async_result()` calls may be required before receiving the final None or raised exception.

        Examples:
            - If the query succeeds with N answers: `query_async_result()` calls 1 to N will receive each answer, in order, and `query_async_result()` call N+1 will return `None`.
            - If the query fails (i.e. has no answers): `query_async_result()` call 1 will return False and `query_async_result()` ` call 2 will return `None`.
