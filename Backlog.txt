- Re-review test code for cleanup opportunities
- Your example code is:
    while True:
        result = prolog_thread.query_async_result()
            if result is None:
                break
            else:
                print(result)

    It’s more “Pythonic” to package this as an iterator:

    for result in prolog_thread.query_iter():
        print(result)
    Also, you might want to consider an interface that is truly asynchronous, so that it works with await.

- How to build:
python3 -m build
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
