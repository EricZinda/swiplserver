- how to distinguish strings and atoms from the JSON?
    - Support options for JSON serialization for encoding false?
    - use json{type:string, value:Term} or "\"\""?
    - true, false
    - dicts
    - use json_write_dict instead?
- Protocol speed improvements
    - Maybe do it the X11 way, where a large part of the protocol consists of operations that are supposed to succeed and (thus) no acknowledge is sent. If one of them fails anyway it is
    normally considered as fatal to the connection.
    - The other trick they use for localhost communication is to use a shared memory segment rather than sockets. ROS does that as well when possible. In my measurements that results in a 25uSec round trip time.
