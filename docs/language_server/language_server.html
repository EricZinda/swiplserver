<p>
The SWI Prolog Language Server is designed to enable "embedding" SWI Prolog into just about any programming language (Python, Go, C#, etc) in a straightforward way. It is designed for scenarios that need to use SWI Prolog as a local implementation detail of another language. Think of it as running SWI Prolog "like a library". It can support any programming language that can launch processes, read their STDOUT pipe, and send and receive JSON over TCP/IP. A Python 3.x library is provided.</p>

<p>
Key features of the server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simulates the familiar Prolog "top level" (i.e. the interactive prompt you get when running Prolog: "?-").</li>
<li>Always runs queries from a connection on a consistent, single thread for that connection. The application itself can still be multi-threaded by running queries that use the multi-threading Prolog predicates or by opening more than one connection.</li>
<li>Runs as a separate dedicated <b>local</b> Prolog process to simplify integration (vs. using the C-level SWI Prolog interface). The process is launched and managed by a specific running client (e.g. Python or other language) program.</li>
<li>Communicates using sockets and JSON encoded as UTF-8 to allow it to work on any platform supported by SWI Prolog. For security reasons, only listens on TCP/IP localhost or Unix Domain Sockets and requires (or generates depending on the options) a password to open a connection.</li>
<li>Has a lightweight text-based message format with only 6 commands: run synchronous query, run asynchronous query, retrieve asynchronous results, cancel asynchronous query, close connection and terminate the session.</li>
<li>Communicates answers using JSON, a well-known data format supported by most languages natively or with generally available libraries.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The server can be used in two different modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Embedded mode</b>: This is the main use case for the server. The user uses a library (just like any other library in their language of choice). That library integrates the language server as an implementation detail by launching the SWI Prolog process, connecting to it, and wrapping the protocol with a language specific interface.</li>
<li><b>Standalone mode</b>: The user still uses a library as above, but launches SWI Prolog independently of the language. The client language library connects to that process. This allows the user to see, interact with, and debug the Prolog process while the library interacts with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note that the language server is related to the pengines library, but where the pengines library is focused on a client/server, multi-tenet, sandboxed environment, the language server is local, single tenet and unconstrained. Thus, when the requirement is to embed Prolog within another programming language "like a library", it can be a good solution for exposing the full power of Prolog with low integration overhead.</p>

<h2 class="wiki">Installation Steps for Any Language</h2>

<p>
In order to use the language server with any programming language:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install SWI Prolog itself on the machine the application will run on.</li>
<li>Ensure that the system path includes a path to the <code>swipl</code> executable from that installation.</li>
<li>Make sure the application (really the user that launches the application) has permission to launch the SWI Prolog process.</li>
<li>Install (or write!) the library you'll be using to access the language server in your language of choice.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The first two should be straightforward.</p>

<p>
For #3, your application will need to have permission to launch the SWI Prolog process. Unless your system is unusually locked down, this should be allowed by default. If not, you'll need to set the appropriate permissions to allow this.</p>

<h2 class="wiki">Prolog Language Differences from the Top Level</h2>

<p>
The language server is designed to act like using the "top level" prompt of SWI Prolog itself (i.e. the "?-" prompt). If you've built the Prolog part of your application by loading code, running it and debugging it using the normal SWI Prolog top level, integrating it with your native language should be straightforward: simply run the commands you'd normally run on the top level, but now run them using the query APIs provided by the library built for your target language. Those APIs will allow you to send the exact same text to Prolog and they should execute the same way.</p>

<p>
While the query functionality of the language server does run on a thread, it will always be the <b>same</b> thread, and, if you use a single connection, it will only allow queries to be run one at a time, just like the top level. Of course, the queries you send can launch threads, just like the top level, so you are not limited to a single threaded application. There are a few differences from the top level, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally, the SWI Prolog top level runs all user code in the context of a built-in module called "user", as does the language server. However, the top level allows this to be changed using the <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=module/1">module/1</a> predicate. This predicate has no effect in the language server.</li>
<li>Predefined streams like <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=user_input/0">user_input/0</a> are initially bound to the standard operating system I/O streams (like STDIN) and, since the Prolog process is running invisibly, will obviously not work as expected. Those streams can be changed, however, by issuing commands using system predicates as defined in the SWI Prolog documentation.</li>
<li>Every connection to the language server runs in its own thread, so opening two connections from an application means you are running multithreaded code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The basic rule to remember is: any predicates designed to interact with or change the default behavior of the top level itself probably won't have any effect.</p>

<h2 class="wiki">Embedded Mode: Integrating the Language Server Into a New Programming Language</h2>

<p>
The most common way to use the language server is to find a library that wraps and exposes it as a native part of another programming language such as Python. This section describes how to build one if there isn't yet a library for your language. To do this, you'll need to familiarize yourself with the server protocol as described in the <a href="language_server.html#language_server/1">language_server/1</a> documentation. However, to give an idea of the scope of work required, below is a typical interaction done (invisibly to the user) in the implementation of any programming language library:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch the SWI Prolog process using (along with any other options the user requests): <code>swipl /&lt;path&gt;/language_server.pl --write_connection_values=true</code>. To work, the <code>swipl</code> Prolog executable will need to be on the path or specified in the command. This launches the server and writes the chosen port and password to STDOUT. This way of launching invokes a (non-exported) predicate called <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=main/1">main/1</a> that turns off the <code>int</code> (i.e. Interrupt/SIGINT) signal to Prolog. This is because some languages (such as Python) use that signal during debugging and it would be otherwise passed to the client Prolog process and switch it into the debugger. Also note that Options are specified using the <code>--&lt;option name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code> syntax on the command line. <code>&lt;value&gt;</code> should be surrounded with double quotation marks when it is a value like a password with spaces that could confuse the command line. See documentation for how to format the command line and the other available options in the <a href="language_server.html#language_server/1">language_server/1</a> Options documentation.</li>
<li>Read the SWI Prolog STDOUT to retrieve the TCP/IP port and password. They are sent in that order, delimited by '\n'.</li>
</ol>

<pre class="code" ext="">
$ swipl language_server.pl --write_connection_values=true
54501
185786669688147744015809740744888120144</pre>

<p>
Now the server is started. To create a connection:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the language's TCP/IP sockets library to open a socket on the specified port of localhost and send the password as a message. Messages to and from the server are in the form <code>&lt;stringByteLength&gt;.\n&lt;stringBytes&gt;.\n </code> where <code>stringByteLength</code> includes the <code>.\n</code> from the string. For example: <code>7.\nhello.\n</code> More information on the message format is in the <a href="language_server.html#language_server/1">language_server/1</a> documentation.</li>
<li>Listen on the socket for a response message of <code>true([[threads(Comm_Thread_ID, Goal_Thread_ID)]])</code> (which will be in JSON form) indicating successful creation of the connection. <var>Comm_Thread_ID</var> and <var>Goal_Thread_ID</var> are the two threads that are used for the connection. They are sent solely for monitoring and debugging purposes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We can test using the Unix tool <code>netcat</code> (also available for windows) to interactively connect to the server. In <code>netcat</code>: hitting enter sends <code>\n</code> and the server responses are recorded inline. I've indented the server responses below to clarify.</p>

<p>
We'll use the port and password that were sent to STDOUT above:</p>

<pre class="code" ext="">
$ nc 127.0.0.1 54501
41.
185786669688147744015809740744888120144.
    173.
    {
      "args": [
        [
          [
        {
          "args": ["language_server1_conn2_comm", "language_server1_conn2_goal" ],
          "functor":"threads"
        }
          ]
        ]
      ],
      "functor":"true"
    }
</pre>

<p>
Now the connection is established. To run queries and shutdown:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any of the messages described in the <a href="language_server.html#language_server/1">language_server/1</a> documentation can now be sent to run queries and retrieve their answers. For example, send the message <code>run(atom(a), -1)</code> to run the synchronous query <code>atom(a)</code> with no timeout and wait for the response message. It will be <code>true([[]])</code> (in JSON form).</li>
<li>Shutting down the connection is accomplished by sending the message <code>close</code>, waiting for the response message of <code>true([[]])</code> (in JSON form), and then closing the socket using the socket API of the language. If the socket is closed (or fails) before the <code>close</code> message is sent, the default behavior of the server is to exit the SWI Prolog process to avoid leaving the process around. This is to support scenarios where the user is running and halting their language debugger without cleanly exiting.</li>
<li>Shutting down the launched server is accomplished by sending the <code>quit</code> message and waiting for the response message of <code>true([[]])</code> (in JSON form). This will cause an orderly shutdown and exit of the process.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Continuing with the <code>netcat</code> session (<code>quit</code> isn't shown since <code>close</code> closes the connection):</p>

<pre class="code" ext="">
18.
run(atom(a), -1).
    39.
    {"args": [ [ [] ] ], "functor":"true"}
7.
close.
    39.
    {"args": [ [ [] ] ], "functor":"true"}</pre>

<p>
Note that Unix Domain Sockets can be used instead of a TCP/IP port. How to do this is described in the <a href="language_server.html#language_server/1">language_server/1</a> Options documentation.</p>

<p>
Here's the same example running in the R language</p>

<pre class="code" ext="">
# Server run with: swipl language_server.pl --port=40001 --password=123
# R Source
print("# Establish connection")

sck = make.socket('localhost', 40001)

print("# Send password")

write.socket(sck, '5.\n') # message length

write.socket(sck, '123.\n') # password

print(read.socket(sck))

print("# Run query")

query = 'run(member(X, [1, 2, 3]), -1).\n'

write.socket(sck, paste(nchar(query), '.\n', sep='')) # message length

write.socket(sck, query) # query

print(read.socket(sck))

print("# Close session")

close.socket(sck)</pre>

<p>
And here's the output:</p>

<pre class="code" ext="">
[1] "# Establish connection"

[1] "# Send password"

[1] "172.\n{\n "args": [\n [\n [\n\t{\n\t "args": ["language_server1_conn1_comm", "language_server1_conn1_goal" ],\n\t "functor":"threads"\n\t}\n ]\n ]\n ],\n "functor":"true"\n}"

[1] "# Run query"

[1] "188.\n{\n "args": [\n [\n [ {"args": ["X", 1 ], "functor":"="} ],\n [ {"args": ["X", 2 ], "functor":"="} ],\n [ {"args": ["X", 3 ], "functor":"="} ]\n ]\n ],\n "functor":"true"\n}"

[1] "# Close session"</pre>

<p>
Other notes about creating a new library to communicate with the language server:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please use the Python library as a reference when designing your language library and use similar names and approaches where appropriate. This will give familiarity and faster learning for users that use more than one language.</li>
<li>Use the <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=debug/1">debug/1</a> predicate described in the <a href="language_server.html#language_server/1">language_server/1</a> documentation to turn on debug tracing. It can really speed up debugging.</li>
<li>Read the STDOUT and STDERR output of the SWI Prolog process and output them to the debugging console of the native language to help users debug their Prolog application.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wiki">Standalone Mode: Debugging Prolog Code Used in an Application</h2>

<p>
When using the language server from another language, debugging the Prolog code itself can often be done by viewing traces from the Prolog native <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=writeln/1">writeln/1</a> or <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=debug/3">debug/3</a> predicates and viewing their output in the debugger of the native language used. Sometimes an issue occurs deep in an application and a way to run the application in the native language while setting breakpoints and viewing traces in Prolog itself is the best approach. Standalone mode is designed for this scenario.</p>

<p>
As the language server is a multithreaded application, debugging the running code requires using the multithreaded debugging features of SWI Prolog as described in the section on "Debugging Threads" in the SWI Prolog documentation. A typical flow for Standalone Mode is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Launch SWI Prolog and call the <a href="language_server.html#language_server/1">language_server/1</a> predicate specifying a port and password. Use the <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=tdebug/0">tdebug/0</a> predicate to set all threads to debugging mode like this: <code>tdebug, language_server(port(4242), password(debugnow))</code>.</li>
<li>Set the port and password in the initialization API in the native language being used.</li>
<li>Launch the application and go through the steps to reproduce the issue.</li>
</ol>

<p>
At this point, all of the multi-threaded debugging tools in SWI Prolog are available for debugging the problem. If the issue is an unexpected exception, the exception debugging features of SWI Prolog can be used to break on the exception and examine the state of the application. If it is a logic error, breakpoints can be set to halt at the point where the problem appears, etc.</p>

<p>
Note that, while using a library to access Prolog will normally end and restart the process between runs of the code, running the server standalone doesn't clear state between launches of the application. You'll either need to relaunch between runs or build your application so that it does the initialization at startup.</p>

<dl>
<dt class="pubdef"><span style="float:right">&nbsp;</span><a name="language_server/1"><b class="pred">language_server</b><var class="arglist">(+Options:list)</var></a> is <b class="det">semidet</b></dt><dd class="defbody">Starts a Prolog language server using <var>Options</var>. The server is normally started automatically by a library built for a particular programming language, but starting manually can be useful when debugging Prolog code in some scenarios. See the documentation on "Standalone Mode" for more information.

<p>
Once started, the server listens for TCP/IP or Unix Domain Socket connections and authenticates them using the password provided (or generated) before processing any messages. The messages processed by the server are described below.</p>

<p>
For debugging, the server outputs traces using the <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=debug/3">debug/3</a> predicate so that the server operation can be observed by using the <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=debug/1">debug/1</a> predicate. Run the following commands to see them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>debug(prologServer(protocol))</code>: Traces protocol messages to show the flow of commands and connections. It is designed to avoid filling the screen with large queries and results to make it easier to read.</li>
<li><code>debug(prologServer(query))</code>: Traces messages that involve each query and its results. Therefore it can be quite verbose depending on the query.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wiki"><var>Options</var></h2>

<p>
<var>Options</var> is a list containing any combination of the following options. When used in the Prolog top level (i.e. in Standalone Mode), these are specified as normal Prolog options like this:</p>

<pre class="code" ext="">
language_server([unix_domain_socket(Socket), password('a password')])</pre>

<p>
When using Embedded mode (i.e. launching the server from the command line when integrating into another language) they are passed using the same name but as normal command line arguments like this:</p>

<pre class="code" ext="">
swipl /&lt;path&gt;/language_server.pl --write_connection_values=true --password="a password" --create_unix_domain_socket=true</pre>

<p>
Note the use of quotes around values that could confuse command line processing like spaces (e.g. "a password") and that <code>unix_domain_socket(Variable)</code> is written as <code>--create_unix_domain_socket=true</code> on the command line. See below for more information.</p>

<dl class="termlist">
<dt class="term"><b class="pred">port</b><var class="arglist">(?Port)</var></dt><dd>The TCP/IP port to bind to on localhost. This option is ignored if the <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=unix_domain_socket/1">unix_domain_socket/1</a> option is set. <var>Port</var> is either a legal TCP/IP port number (integer) or a variable term like <var>Port</var>. If it is a variable, it causes the system to select a free port and unify the variable with the selected port as in <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=tcp_bind/2">tcp_bind/2</a>. If the option <code>write_connection_values(true)</code> is set, the selected port is output to STDOUT followed by <code>\n</code> on startup to allow the client language library to retrieve it in Embedded Mode.</dd>
<dt class="term"><b class="pred">unix_domain_socket</b><var class="arglist">(?Unix_Domain_Socket_Path_And_File)</var></dt><dd>If set, Unix Domain Sockets will be used as the way to communicate with the server. <var>Unix_Domain_Socket_Path_And_File</var> specifies the fully qualified path and filename to use for the socket.

<p>
To have one generated instead (recommended), pass <var>Unix_Domain_Socket_Path_And_File</var> as a variable when calling from the Prolog top level and the variable will be unified with a created filename. If launching in Embedded Mode (as described in the section on "Embedded Mode"), instead pass <code>--create_unix_domain_socket=true</code> since there isn't a way to specify variables from the command line. When generating the file, a temporary directory will be created using <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=tmp_file/2">tmp_file/2</a> and socket file will be created within that directory following the below requirements. If the directory and file are unable to be created for some reason, <a href="language_server.html#language_server/1">language_server/1</a> fails.</p>

<p>
Regardless of whether the file is specified or generated, if the option <code>write_connection_values(true)</code> is set, the fully qualified path to the generated file is output to STDOUT followed by <code>\n</code> on startup to allow the client language library to retrieve it.</p>

<p>
Specifying a file to use should follow the same guidelines as the generated file:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the file exists when the server is launched, it will be deleted.</li>
<li>If the path is not an absolute path, an exception will be thrown.</li>
<li>The Prolog process will attempt to create and, if Prolog exits cleanly, delete this file (and directory if it was created) when the server closes. This means the directory from a specified file must have the appropriate permissions to allow the Prolog process to do so.</li>
<li>For security reasons, the filename should not be predictable and the directory it is contained in should have permissions set so that files created are only accessible to the current user.</li>
<li>The path must be below 92 <b>bytes</b> long (including null terminator) to be portable according to the Linux documentation.</li>
</ul>

Regardless of whether the password is specified or generated, if the option <code>write_connection_values(true)</code> is set, the password is output to STDOUT followed by <code>\n</code> on startup to allow the client language library to retrieve it.

</dl>

<h2 class="wiki">Language Server Messages</h2>

<p>
The messages the server responds to are described below. A few things are true for all of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every connection is in its own separate thread. Opening more than one connection means the code is running concurrently.</li>
<li>Closing the socket without sending <code>close</code> and waiting for a response will halt the process if running in Embedded Mode. This is so that stopping a debugger doesn't leave the process orphaned.</li>
<li>All messages are request/response messages. After sending, there will be exactly one response from the server.</li>
<li>Timeout in all of the commands is in seconds. Sending a variable (e.g. <var>_</var>) or <code>-1</code> means no timeout.</li>
<li>All queries are run in the default module context of <code>user</code>. <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=module/1">module/1</a> has no effect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wiki">Language Server Message Format</h3>

<p>
Every language server message is a single valid Prolog term. Those that run queries have an argument which represents the query as a single term. To run several goals at once use <code>(goal1, goal2, ...)</code> as the goal term.</p>

<p>
The format of sent and received messages is identical: <code>&lt;stringByteLength&gt;.\n&lt;stringBytes&gt;.\n</code>. For example: <code>7.\nhello.\n</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;stringByteLength&gt;</code> is the number of bytes of the string to follow (including the <code>.\n</code>), in human readable numbers, such as <code>15</code> for a 15 byte string. It must be followed by <code>.\n</code>.</li>
<li><code>&lt;stringBytes&gt;</code> is the actual message string being sent, such as <code>run(atom(a), -1).\n</code>. It must always end with <code>.\n</code>. The character encoding used to decode and encode the string is UTF-8.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To send a message to the server, send a message using the message format above to the localhost port or Unix Domain Socket that the server is listening on. For example, to run the synchronous goal <code>atom(a)</code>, send the following message:</p>

<pre class="code" ext="">
18.\nrun(atom(a), -1).\n&lt;end of stream&gt;</pre>

<p>
You will receive the response below on the receive stream of the same connection you sent on. If a message takes longer than 2 seconds, there will be "heartbeat" characters (".") at the beginning of the response message, approximately 1 every 2 seconds. So, if the query takes 6 seconds for some reason, there will be three "." characters first:</p>

<pre class="code" ext="">
...12\ntrue([[]]).\n</pre>

<h3 class="wiki">Language Server Messages Reference</h3>

<p>
The full list of language server messages are described below.</p>

<h4 class="wiki"><code>run(Goal, Timeout)</code></h4>

<p>
Runs <var>Goal</var> on the connection's designated query thread. Stops accepting new commands until the query is finished and it has responded with the results. If a previous query is still in progress, waits until the previous query finishes (discarding that query's results) before beginning the new query.</p>

<p>
While it is waiting for the query to complete, sends a "." character <b>not</b> in message format, just as a single character, once every two seconds to proactively ensure that the client is alive. Those should be read and discarded by the client.</p>

<p>
If a communication failure happens (during a heartbeat or otherwise), the connection is terminated, the query is aborted and (if running in Embedded Mode) the SWI Prolog process shuts down.</p>

<p>
When completed, sends a response message using the normal message format indicating the result.</p>

<p>
Response:</p>

<table class="wiki">

<h4 class="wiki"><code>run_async(Goal, Timeout, Find_All)</code></h4>

<p>
Starts a Prolog query on the connection's designated query thread. Answers to the query, including exceptions, are retrieved afterwards by sending the <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> message (described below). The query can be cancelled by sending the <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=cancel_async/0">cancel_async/0</a> message. If a previous query is still in progress, waits until that query finishes (discarding that query's results) before responding.</p>

<p>
If the socket closes before a response is sent, the connection is terminated, the query is aborted and (if running in embedded mode) the SWI Prolog process shuts down.</p>

<p>
If it needs to wait for the previous query to complete, it will send heartbeat messages (see the `Language Server Message Format` section) while it waits. After it responds, however, it does not send more heartbeats. This is so that it can begin accepting new commands immediately after responding so the client.</p>

<p>
<code>Find_All == true</code> means generate one response in <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> with all of the answers to the query (as in <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=run/2">run/2</a> above). <code>Find_All == false</code> generates a single response in <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> per answer.</p>

<p>
Response:</p>

<table class="wiki">
<tr><td><code>true([[]])</code></td><td>The goal was successfully parsed.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(Exception)</code></td><td>An error occurred parsing the goal.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(connection_failed)</code></td><td>The goal thread unexpectedly shut down. The server will no longer be listening after this exception.</td></tr>
</table>

<h4 class="wiki">cancel_async</h4>

<p>
Attempt to cancel a query started with <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=run_async/3">run_async/3</a> in a way that allows further queries to be run on this Prolog thread afterwards.</p>

<p>
If there is a goal running, injects a <code>throw(cancel_goal)</code> into the executing goal to attempt to stop the goal's execution. Begins accepting new commands immediately after responding. Does not inject <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=abort/0">abort/0</a> because this would kill the connection's designated thread and the system is designed to maintain thread local data for the client. This does mean it is a "best effort" cancel since the exception can be caught.</p>

<p>
<code>cancel_async</code> is guaranteed to either respond with an exception (if there is no query or pending results from the last query), or safely attempt to stop the last executed query even if it has already finished.</p>

<p>
To guarantee that a query is cancelled, send <code>close</code> and close the socket.</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to determine the outcome of <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=cancel_async/0">cancel_async/0</a> after sending it and receiving a response. Further queries can be immediately run. They will start after the current query stops.</p>

<p>
However, if you do need to determine the outcome or determine when the query stops, send <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a>. Using <code>Timeout = 0</code> is recommended since the query might have caught the exception or still be running. Sending <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> will find out the "natural" result of the goal's execution. The "natural" result depends on the particulars of what the code actually did. The response could be:</p>

<table class="wiki">
<tr><td><code>exception(cancel_goal)</code></td><td>The query was running and did not catch the exception. I.e. the goal was successfully cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(time_limit_exceeded)</code></td><td>The query timed out before getting cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(Exception)</code></td><td>They query hits another exception before it has a chance to be cancelled.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A valid answer</td><td>The query finished before being cancelled.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that you will need to continue sending <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> until you receive an <code>exception(Exception)</code> message if you want to be sure the query is finished (see documentation for <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a>).</p>

<p>
Response:</p>

<table class="wiki">
<tr><td><code>true([[]])</code></td><td>There is a query running or there are pending results for the last query.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(no_query)</code></td><td>There is no query or pending results from a query to cancel.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>exception(connection_failed)</code></td><td>The connection has been unexpectedly shut down. The server will no longer be listening after this exception.</td></tr>

<h4 class="wiki"><code>async_result(Timeout)</code></h4>

<p>
Get results from a query that was run via <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=run_async/3">run_async/3</a>. Used to get results for all cases: if the query terminates normally, is cancelled by <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=cancel_async/0">cancel_async/0</a>, or times out. Each call responds with one result and, when there are no more results, responds with <code>exception(no_more_results)</code> or whatever exception stopped the query. Receiving any <code>exception</code> response except <code>exception(result_not_available)</code> means there are no more results. If <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=run_async/3">run_async/3</a> was run with <code>Find_All == false</code>, multiple <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> messages may be required before receiving the final exception.</p>

<p>
Waits <var>Timeout</var> seconds for a result (<code>Timeout == -1</code> means forever). If the timeout is exceeded and no results are ready, sends <code>exception(result_not_available)</code>.</p>

<p>
Some examples:</p>

<table class="wiki">
<tr><td>If the query succeeds with N answers...</td><td><a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> messages 1 to N will receive each answer in order and <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> message N+1 will receive <code>exception(no_more_results)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>If the query fails (i.e. has no answers)...</td><td><a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> message 1 will receive <code>false</code> and <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> message 2 will receive <code>exception(no_more_results)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>If the query times out after one answer...</td><td><a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> message 1 will receive the first answer and <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> message 2 will receive <code>exception(time_limit_exceeded)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>If the query is cancelled after it had a chance to get 3 answers...</td><td><a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> messages 1 to 3 will receive each answer in order and <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> message 4 will receive <code>exception(cancel_goal)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>If the query throws an exception before returning any results...</td><td><a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> message 1 will receive <code>exception(Exception)</code></td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Note that, after sending <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=cancel_async/0">cancel_async/0</a>, calling <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=async_result/1">async_result/1</a> will return the "natural" result of the goal's execution. The "natural" result depends on the particulars of what the code actually did since this is multi-threaded and there are race conditions. This is described more below in the response section and above in <a class="extmanual" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=cancel_async/0">cancel_async/0</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wiki">close</h4>

<p>
Closes a connection cleanly, indicating that the subsequent socket close is not a connection failure. Thus it doesn't shutdown the server in Embedded Mode. The response must be processed by the client before closing the socket or it will be interpreted as a connection failure.</p>

<p>
Any asynchronous query that is still running will be halted by using <a class="builtin" href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?predicate=abort/0">abort/0</a> in the connection's query thread.</p>

<p>
Response:
<code>true([[]])</code></p>

<h4 class="wiki">quit</h4>

<p>
Stops the server and ends the SWI Prolog process. This allows client language libraries to ask for an orderly shutdown of the Prolog process.</p>
